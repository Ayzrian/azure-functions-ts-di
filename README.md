Azure Functions with TS and DI on Inversify project starter


## Programmatic Model Version

At the moment of creation the Azure officially supports v3 programmatic model, but there is already a v4 in a preview that
drastically changes the way we code with Azure Functions.

This example can be adjusted to the v4 model with some effort, but as of the moment of creation I don't see reason to invest effort 
into it since v4 is still in the preview mode and may be changed.

Feel free to contribute if you want to adopt this example for a v4 programmatic model.
